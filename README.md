### From healthcare to computers 

I'm a biologist with a master in molecular biomedicine. Recently discovered the world of computers and programming and decided to start the journey of becoming a software developer. Started on my own learning python and then joinned an introductory course to programming in C# at the University of Aveiro. Now I'm now finishing a Python programming course at Tokio School of Technology.
